class Coding(object):
    code: str  # REQUIRED	string	The code for what is being represente
    system: str = ""  # OPTIONAL	string	A codesystem for this code.
    display: str = ""  # OPTIONAL	string	A short, human-readable label to display.


@dataclass
class Source(object):
    label: str  # REQUIRED A short, human-readable label to display for the source of the information displayed on this card. If a url is also specified, this MAY be the text for the hyperlink.
    url: str = ""  # OPTIONAL An optional absolute URL to load (via GET, in a browser context) when a user clicks on this link to learn more about the organization or data set that provided the information on this card. Note that this URL should not be used to supply a context-specific "drill-down" view of the information on this card. For that, use link.url instead.
    icon: str = ""  # OPTIONAL An absolute URL to an icon for the source of this card. The icon returned by this URL SHOULD be a 100x100 pixel PNG image without any transparent regions.
    topic: Coding = field(
        default_factory=list)  # OPTIONAL A topic describes the content of the card by providing a high-level categorization that can be useful for filtering, searching or ordered display of related cards in the CDS client's UI. This specification does not prescribe a standard set of topics.

@dataclass
class Action(object):

    description: str  # REQUIRED string	Human-readable description of the suggested action MAY be presented to the end-user.
    resource: object = field(default_factory=dict)


@dataclass
class Link(object):
    label: str  # REQUIRED	string	Human-readable label to display for this link (e.g. the CDS Client might render this as the underlined text of a clickable link).
    url: str  # REQUIRED	URL	URL to load (via GET, in a browser context) when a user clicks on this link. Note that this MAY be a "deep link" with context embedded in path segments, query parameters, or a hash.
    type: str  # REQUIRED	string	The type of the given URL. There are two possible values for this field. A type of absolute indicates that the URL is absolute and should be treated as-is. A type of smart indicates that the URL is a SMART app launch URL and the CDS Client should ensure the SMART app launch URL is populated with the appropriate SMART launch parameters.
    appContext: str = ""  # OPTIONAL	string	An optional field that allows the CDS Service to share information from the CDS card with a subsequently launched SMART app. The appContext field should only be valued if the link type is smart and is not valid for absolute links. The appContext field and value will be sent to the SMART app as part of the OAuth 2.0 access token response, alongside the other SMART launch parameters when the SMART app is launched. Note that appContext could be escaped JSON, base64 encoded XML, or even a simple string, so long as the SMART app can recognize it.

    indicator: str  # REQUIRED	string	Urgency/importance of what this card conveys. Allowed values, in order of increasing urgency, are: info, warning, critical. The CDS Client MAY use this field to help make UI display decisions such as sort order or coloring.
    summary: str  # REQUIRED	string	One-sentence, <140-character summary message for display to the user inside of this card.
    source: Source  # REQUIRED	object	Grouping structure for the Source of the information displayed on this card. The source should be the primary source of guidance for the decision support the card represents.
    uuid: str = None  # OPTIONAL	string	Unique identifier of the card. MAY be used for auditing and logging cards and SHALL be included in any subsequent calls to the CDS service's feedback endpoint.
    detail: str = None  # OPTIONAL	string	Optional detailed information to display; if provided MUST be represented in (GitHub Flavored) Markdown. (For non-urgent cards, the CDS Client MAY hide these details until the user clicks a link like "view more details...").
    suggestions: List[Suggestion] = field(
        default_factory=list)  # OPTIONAL	array of Suggestions	Allows a service to suggest a set of changes in the context of the current activity (e.g. changing the dose of the medication currently being prescribed, for the medication-prescribe activity). If suggestions are present, selectionBehavior MUST also be provided.
    selectionBehavior: str = None  # OPTIONAL	string	Describes the intended selection behavior of the suggestions in the card. Allowed values are: at-most-one, indicating that the user may choose none or at most one of the suggestions;any, indicating that the end user may choose any number of suggestions including none of them and all of them. CDS Clients that do not understand the value MUST treat the card as an error.
    overrideReasons: List[
        Coding] = None  # OPTIONAL	array of Coding	Override reasons can be selected by the end user when overriding a card without taking the suggested recommendations. The CDS service MAY return a list of override reasons to the CDS client. The CDS client SHOULD present these reasons to the clinician when they dismiss a card. A CDS client MAY augment the override reasons presented to the user with its own reasons.
